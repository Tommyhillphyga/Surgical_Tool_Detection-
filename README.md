# Surgical_Tool_Detection

The Surgical tools detection application is a seamless integration of  YOLOv9 and a Language model and using Gradio as the user interface. 

The application helps medical practitioners detect and identify medical tools and also inform the doctor on any missing tools in the tool box after a surgical operation is performed. 

This state-of-the-art application utilizes the prowess of the YOLOv9 model, fine-tuned using a comprehensive dataset from Roboflow https://universe.roboflow.com/nust-n4uwu/yolo-x6unl/dataset/1
